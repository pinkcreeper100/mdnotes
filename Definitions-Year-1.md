## Mechanics

### Forces in equilibrium
- If it is possible to draw a closed polygon (of three or more forces) then the system of forces must be in equilibrium

### Centre of mass
- **The centre of mass is the point through which all the weight of an object is deemed to act.**

### Moments
- A moment is defined as a force, F, multiplied by the perpendicular distance, d, from the *line of action* of the force to the pivot

### The Principle of Moments
For a system to be in **equilibrium**, the **total clockwise moments**
about a point must equal the **total anticlockwise moments**
about the same point.

### Rules for equilibrium
**For a system or body to be in equilibrium,**

The resultant force must be zero [If there are three forces, the sum must form a closed triangle]
The resultant moment must be zero [The total of the moments about any point must equal zero]

### Couples
**A couple is defined as being a pair of equal and opposite forces acting on a body, but not along the same line of action.**

### Motion Graphs
- **Displacement** is distance from a fixed point **in a given direction**. (Vector quantity)
- **Velocity** is rate of change of displacement. (Vector quantity)
- **Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity. (Vector quantity)
RATE means the change in something each second

### Newton's Laws of Motion
**Newton’s 1st Law of Motion** states that if no **resultant** force acts on an
object, then it will either remain at rest, or continue moving with
constant velocity. 

**Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion** is the equation $F = ma$
Force is measured in newtons (N), mass in kg and acceleration in $ms^{-2}$.

Newton’s 3rd Law of Motion is that when two objects interact, they exert an equal and
opposite force on each other.

### Work Done
Work Done is Energy transferred by means of a force
