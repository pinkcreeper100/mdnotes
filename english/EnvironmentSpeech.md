Hello everyone, my name is Oliver and I'm here to speak to you about how you, can 
protect the environment!
Yes, I know it's boring, but hear me out, this is important, and it affects everyone.

## Transport

First thing I'll talk about is transport.

One way to save the planet is to change the way you travel. How do you get to college? 
If you live quite a way away from college, do you travel by car? Have you considered taking the bus instead?
Travelling by bus produces 65% less Carbon Dioxide than when you travel by car,
as you are generally sharing the bus with others.

## Recycling

One thing that is generally missed is recycling.

Have you ever written part of an essay and then decided that you want to restart?
Instead of chucking the paper in the bin, why not put it in the recycle bin instead?

## Locally-sourced food

Probably one of the most important things about life is of course, food.

Instead of going to a large chain to eat, you could go to your local food outlet.
They're more likely to have ingredients from local suppliers than, say, Subway.
