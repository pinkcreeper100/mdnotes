## Introduction

I've been looking for a monitor upgrade and this one (Viewsonic VX2458) caught my interest,
as it has a high refresh rate/low latency panel.

## Delivery

The monitor arrived earlier than expected, and had no damage from delivery.

## Pros

It has 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, AMD Freesync and it's curved.
Does the job well.

## Cons
