Dear Sir or Madam

I am writing to you to express my opinions about a letter that appeared
recently in your newspaper regarding the proposed changes to the
drinking age.

I believe this is a good idea because too many accidents happen because of
drink-driving. In the period 2010-2020, there was a total of 86420 casualties
in the UK [1](https://www.quittance.co.uk/uk-drink-driving-statistics) .

Secondly, it is a good idea because drinking too much can damage your
health. As alcohol is a causal factor in more than 60 medical conditions, including: 
mouth, throat, stomach, liver and breast cancers; high blood pressure, 
cirrhosis of the liver; and depression [2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-public-health-burden-of-alcohol-evidence-review) .

However, I also think that it is down to choice, because if people choose 
to drink at 18 then they will do!

Something needs to be done about the effects of drinking but I'm not sure
changing the age would make a big difference.

Yours faithfully,

Lisa Greenhough
