Dear Sir or Madam

I am writing to you to express my opinions about a letter that appeared
recently in your newspaper regarding the proposed changes two the
drinking age.

I believe this is a good idea because too many accidents happen because of
drink-driving. If you make the age 21 then less accidents would happen.
That makes sense!

Secondly, it is a good idea because drinking too much can damage your
health.

However, I also think that it shouldnâ€™t be changed because nobody will
listen to it any way. If people want to drink at 18 then they will do!

Something needs to be dun about the effects of drinking but I'm not sure
changing the age would make a big difference.

Yours faithfully,

Lisa Greenhough
