## Mechanics

### Forces in equilibrium

- If it is possible to draw a closed polygon (of three or more forces) then the system of forces must be in equilibrium

### Centre of mass

- **The centre of mass is the point through which all the weight of an object is deemed to act.**

### Moments

- A moment is defined as a force, $F$, multiplied by the perpendicular distance, $d$, from the *line of action* of the force to the pivot

### The Principle of Moments

For a system to be in **equilibrium**, the **total clockwise moments**
about a point must equal the **total anticlockwise moments**
about the same point.

### Rules for equilibrium

**For a system or body to be in equilibrium,**

The resultant force must be zero [If there are three forces, the sum must form a closed triangle]
The resultant moment must be zero [The total of the moments about any point must equal zero]

### Couples

**A couple is defined as being a pair of equal and opposite forces acting on a body, but not along the same line of action.**

### Motion Graphs

- **Displacement** is distance from a fixed point **in a given direction**. (Vector quantity)
- **Velocity** is rate of change of displacement. (Vector quantity)
- **Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity. (Vector quantity)
RATE means the change in something each second

### Newton's Laws of Motion

**Newton’s 1st Law of Motion** states that if no **resultant** force acts on an
object, then it will either remain at rest, or continue moving with
constant velocity.

**Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion** is the equation $F = ma$
Force is measured in newtons (N), mass in kg and acceleration in $ms^{-2}$.

Newton’s 3rd Law of Motion is that when two objects interact, they exert an equal and
opposite force on each other.

### Work Done

Work Done is Energy transferred by means of a force

### Newton's Second Law revisited

The **impulse** of a force is defined as the force x the time for which the force
acts and is equal to the change in momentum of the object in response to the force.

$F Δt = Δ(mv)$

### Force-time graphs

The area under a force-time graph = $F * t$ = change of momentum or impulse of the force.

### Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

An **elastic** collision is one where the is **no loss of kinetic energy**.
Total kinetic energy before the collision = total kinetic energy before the collision.

An **inelastic** collision is one where there is some loss of kinetic energy.
Momentum will be conserved, as always, but **some of the kinetic energy
has been converted to other forms, usually heat.

In a **totally inelastic** collision, the colliding objects stick together after colliding.

## Practical Skills

### Types of error in measurements

**Random errors** are caused by unpredictable effects, such as small amounts of friction,
thermal vibrations, draughts, and especially human judgement and reaction times.
Random errors are (as the name suggests) always different when measurements are
repeated, and repeated measurements are used to reduce their effect.

**Systematic errors** are caused by inaccuracies in the measuring system, such as a
calibration error, zero error, or an effect that cannot readily be measured like heat
losses. Systematic errors do ***not*** cause a variation when measurements are repeated,
and there is nothing that can be done to reduce their effect without re-designing the
experiment to an extent. They are often difficult to spot, but can sometimes be seen by
looking at the intercept of a gradient

### Terms used in connection with experiments and experimental error

**Precision** is the extent to which measurements agree with each other - i.e. the lack of
significant variation in readings.

**Accuracy** is how close a measurement is to the true value - i.e. how close to the result of
an "ideal experiment".

**Repeatability** - A measurement is repeatable if the original experimenter repeats the
investigation using same method and equipment and obtains the same results.

**Reproducibility** - A measurement is reproducible if the investigation is repeated by
another person, or by using different equipment or techniques, and the same results are
obtained.

**Resolution** - the resolution of an instrument is the smallest difference in readings it can
show.

**Absolute** uncertainty is the interval within which the true value can be expected to lie e.g.
the temperature is $20 °C \pm 2 °C$. Should always be expressed with an appropriate unit.

**Fractional uncertainty** is given by $\frac{\textnormal{Absolute Uncertainty}}{\textnormal{Quantity}}$

**Percentage uncertainty** is given by $\text{fractional uncertainty} \times 100%$.

## Materials

### Hooke's Law

The extension produced by a force in a wire or spring is
directly proportional to the force applied, up to the limit of
proportionality.

### Material Properties

**Elastic behaviour** is when a sample that has been deformed by a force returns to its original shape and size
when the force causing the deformation is removed.

**Plastic behaviour** is the opposite of an elastic behaviour, when the deforming force is removed the material
does not return to its original shape/size.

**Elastic Limit** is the maximum amount that a material can be stretched by a force, and still return to its original
length when the force is removed

**Yield Point:** is the point at which the material extends considerably with no (or a very small) increase in
force. The extension is permanent.

**Ductile:** A ductile material can be easily and permanently stretched; e.g. drawn out into wires like copper.

A **Brittle** material **fractures** very soon after the elastic limit, with little or no plastic deformation. These
materials tend to be very strong under compression but weak under tension. E.g. concrete, ceramic, brick,
glass

### Strain Energy

$E = 0.5 k ΔL^2$

$E = \frac{F L}{A e}$

## Particles

### Nuclear Atomic Model

The size of a nucleus is about $1 \times 10^{-14}$
The diameter of the atom is about $1 \times 10^{-10}$

### Isotopes

Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons
but a different number of neutrons and therefore different
nucleon number.

### Energy and Mass

1 electron volt is the Kinetic Energy acquired by an electron when accelerated by a
potential difference 1 Volt.

### Particles and Antiparticles

Antiparticles form antimatter.

- A particle has the same mass as its antiparticle.
- A particle and its antiparticle have equal and opposite charge.

The neutron, when not inside the nucleus, is unstable and will decay to a proton
in about 10 minutes.

### Particle-Antiparticle Annihilation

This is the conversion of the mass of a particle and its antiparticle to energy in the
form of a pair of photons of EM radiation.

### Pair Production

This is the process in which a photon of EM radiation ceases to exist, creating a
particle and its antiparticle pair in its place.

### Neutrinos

The neutrino was originally hypothesised because energy did not appear to be conserved
during beta decay

### Radioactive Decay

#### alpha decay

Only happens in large, unstable nuclei. The nucleus ejects 2 protons and 2
neutrons.

#### beta-minus decay

A nucleus with too many neutrons for its number of protons can undergo
beta-minus decay to improve its p to n ratio.
A neutron in the nucleus changes into a proton, an electron and an anti-
neutrino. The beta-minus particle is the electron which is "flung out" of the nucleus
together with the anti-neutrino

#### beta-plus decay

A nucleus with too few neutrons for its number of protons can undergo beta-
plus decay to improve its p to n ratio.
A proton in the nucleus changes into a neutron, a positron and a neutrino.
The beta-plus particle is the positron which is "flung out" of the nucleus together
with the neutrino

### Fundamental forces

- **Electromagnetic force**
  - **Range**: Infinite
  - **Acts on**: All charged particles

- **Strong interaction**
  - **Range**: $0 - 0.5$ fm repulsive
               $0.5 - 3$ or $4$ fm attractive
  - **Acts on**: Quarks and hadrons
  - **Also known as**: strong nuclear force

  - **Range**: $\times 10^{-18}$
  - **Acts on**: Quarks and leptons

- **Gravity**
  - **Range**: Infinite
  - **Acts on**: All particles

### Quarks

Quarks are fundamental particles which combine to make **hadrons**. Hadrons are particles
which are subject to the strong nuclear force.

### Hadrons

A **meson** is a combination of a quark and an antiquark
A **baryon** is a combination of three quarks or three antiquarks

#### Baryons

|Particle|Quark Content|
|---|---|
|$p$|$uud$|
|$n$|$udd$|

|Anti-particle|Quark Content|
|---|---|
|$\bar{p}$|$\bar{u} \bar{u} \bar{d}$|
|$\bar{n}$|$\bar{u} \bar{d} \bar{d}$|

#### Mesons

|Meson|Quark Content|
|:---:|:---:|
|$\pi^{+}$|$u \bar{d}$|
|$\pi^{-}$|$\bar{u} d$|
|$\pi^{0}$ |$u \bar{u}$|
|$\pi^{0}$|$d \bar{d}$|
|$K^{+}$ |$u \bar{s}$|
|$K^{-}$ |$\bar{u} s$|
|$K^{0}$ |$d \bar{s}$|
|$\bar{K}^{0}$|$\bar{d} s$|

### Hadrons 2

- All baryons have Baryon number = 1, all antibaryons have Baryon number = - 1 and
  all mesons, and anti-mesons have Baryon number = 0.
- Particles and their antiparticles have equal and opposite values of strangeness.
- The proton is the only baryon which is stable. All other baryons decay to protons,
  either directly or indirectly. Mesons decay, either directly or indirectly, into photons or
  leptons.

### Allowed interactions

- Total charge before = total charge after (Conservation of Charge)
- Total baryon number before = total baryon number after (conservation of Baryon Number)
- Total lepton number before = total lepton number after (conservation of lepton number)

**ALL reactions obey these three conservation laws**

- Total strangeness before = total strangeness after (conservation of strangeness)

**This IS conserved in the strong interaction but
is NOT always obeyed during weak interaction**

## Electricity

### Electron flow and conventional current

When doing electrical examples remember that although electricity is often a
flow of electrons from the negative end of a battery to the positive end,
but current is defined as the flow of positive charge, so conventional current
is actually in the opposite direction to the electron flow!

### Ohm's law

The current flowing through a metallic conductor is
Directly proportional to the potential difference
(p.D) applied across it (at constant temperature)

**The potential difference required across a component per
amp of current flowing through it**

### Definition of Potential Difference

The potential difference between two points is the amount of energy transformed
when one coulomb of charge is moved between the two points.

### UK mains voltage

230V

### Power and energy transferred

Energy transferred = Power × time

energy transformed by a component, $E = VI \times t$

### Ohmic conductors

Anything which conducts electricity and obeys Ohm's law is called an ohmic
conductor.

### Kirchhoff's Laws

#### First Law

At any junction in a circuit the sum of the current flowing into the junction is equal to the sum of the current flowing away from it.

#### Second Law

In any complete "loop" of a circuit the sum of p.d.'s equals the source p.d.
